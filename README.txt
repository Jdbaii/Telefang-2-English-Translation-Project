Telefang 2 English Translation Project
======================================

How to use:
1. Get a copy of the Telefang 2 Power ROM
2. Patch it with the IPS patch included "2009telefang2patch.ips"
3. Rename it to power_2009trans.gba, create a directory named rom and place it in there.
4. Now you can build the translated ROM using build_bootleg_power.bat

Modifying script:
The script is stored in script\tf2_bootleg_script_autowrite.txt
Modify this before running the BAT file to change the translations.
However, make sure line breaks are no more than 28 characters apart or the game may force a line break in the middle of a word.

Extracting script:
You can extract the script from the ROM using the files in the Cartographer directory.
Just name your ROMs bootleg.gba, power.gba or speed.gba according to the version, place them in there and run one of the BAT files.
However the script already extracted is heavily modified to work better in game, so it is not recommended to re-extract it.

Other notes:
To create the bootleg ROM this translation was extracted from, you can use "t2tobootleg.ips" to patch the original Power version ROM.
